## Notes for instructor
I did my project 2, because I wasn't sure I would be able to get my project 1 working correctly. This was still a struggle for me! 

I mainly referenced your week 15 and the zipfoods lectures to get the underlying areas working - by doing this project, the ideas clicked better, but my ability to maneuver it is still shaky at best. I am looking forward to reviewing the material after this class, and I am so grateful that your lectures and notes are very clear and will remain available.
